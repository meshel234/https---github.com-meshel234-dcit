        <h3>Become a Frontend Web Developer</h3><br>
        <p>Being a front-end developer is akin to being an architect for websites and apps. Your
            responsibility is to construct and uphold what users observe and engage with on a
            website, encompassing everything from the overall layout to the responsive behavior of
            buttons upon user interaction. As a front-end developer, your role involves bringing
            ideas and designs to life.<br><br>
            The program commences with Dcit Prelim, a 3-week module designed to equip you for
            success in the digital workforce. During this phase, you will acquire essential
            communication, leadership, and career-building skills, setting the foundation for your
            evolution into a well-rounded professional.<br><br>
            Subsequently, you'll delve into the fundamentals of coding using HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript, with a simultaneous focus on crafting user-friendly website designs.
            Practical projects interspersed throughout the program lead up to a capstone project
            where you'll showcase your skills by publishing your own website.<br><br>
            Regardless of your current skill level, this program is structured to guide you from a
            novice to a job-ready developer within a span of 3 months.</p><br>
